# EDLClosedVal — value-level closure for closed EDL terms

GPT Pro's #3-ranked frontier target (consultation 2026-05-10):
formalize the structural ceiling of Plan D (EDL per-primitive
completeness). The 8 sealed witnesses already cover atoms, exp x,
log x, x/y, exp(exp x), log(log x); the remaining 28 paper primitives
(arithmetic, trigonometric, hyperbolic, the constants −1, 2, ½, …)
are conjecturally unreachable from **closed** EDL terms — terms with
no free variables.

This module establishes the closure-theorem half of the structural
ceiling. The other half (the actual transcendence-barrier hypothesis)
is left as a named typeclass `EDLTranscendenceBarrier`, which a future
Mathlib-side Schanuel-style result would need to instantiate.

## What's here

- `EDLClosedVal : ℝ → Prop` — inductive predicate giving the exact
  set of values produced by closed `EDLTerm` evaluations. Generated
  by `1`, `Real.exp 1`, and the `edl(a, b) = exp(a) / log(b)`
  combinator on values where `log b ≠ 0`.
- `EDLTerm.IsClosed : EDLTerm → Prop` — terms with no `var n` leaves.
- `edl_closed_eval_in_closedVal` — the closure theorem: every value
  produced by a closed-term evaluation lies in `EDLClosedVal`. Proved
  by induction on the term.
- `EDLTranscendenceBarrier` — typeclass packaging the three
  non-membership facts `EDLClosedVal {-1, 2, 1/2}` we'd need from
  transcendence theory. Conjectural; not provided here.
- `no_closed_edl_*` — three concrete corollaries: assuming the
  barrier, no closed `EDLTerm` evaluates to `-1`, `2`, or `1/2`.

## Why this is **not** a Schanuel proof

Pro flagged that "the closed-EDL value set lives in a fixed
transcendence-degree extension of ℚ(e)" is probably false: iterates
like `e, exp e, exp(exp e), …` should generate unbounded transcendence
degree under Schanuel's conjecture. So the barrier is genuinely
unproven and we keep it as a typeclass hypothesis rather than
asserting it.

The `process_archive/chunks/085` commentary from Aristotle remains the source-of-record
informal argument; this module is the formal scaffolding around that
commentary.

/-- Inductive predicate **containing** the values reachable as
evaluations of **closed** `EDLTerm`s (terms with no `var` leaves).
The constructors mirror the EDL grammar: `1` and `Real.exp 1` are
the two atomic constants, and the `edl` combinator generates new
values via `exp(a) / log(b)` when `log b ≠ 0`.

We prove containment (`edl_closed_eval_in_closedVal` below) but not
the converse. So `EDLClosedVal v` should be read as "`v` is in a
superset of the closed-EDL value set", not "`v` is in the exact
closed-EDL value set". -/

/-! ## The transcendence-barrier hypothesis

The values `-1`, `2`, and `1/2` are conjecturally not in
`EDLClosedVal`. Proving this in Mathlib would require a Schanuel-style
result connecting the transcendence degree of the EL-closure of
`{1, e}` to the integers — currently out of reach. We package the
three non-membership facts as a typeclass so that downstream theorems
can be stated cleanly.

A future Mathlib instance of `EDLTranscendenceBarrier` would close
the structural ceiling for the corresponding EDL paper claims; until
then, the typeclass is intentionally not provided.
